# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

#Purpose and Background of Project

Our client, Louise produced a play Fever that she used Kickstarter for to try and fund it’s production, and it came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 

Moving forward,  she would like to know how other Kickstarter campaigns fared, specifically, in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Answering these questions is the purpose of this analysis so that when Louise plans her next Kickstarter campaign, she will hopefully be able to take that information and ensure that her next campaign will be as successful as possible.

By using the Kickstarter dataset and through the use of pivot tables and graphs, we set out to both;
  - visualize how campaign outcomes (those that were successful, those that failed, and those that were cancelled) are affected by when they were l l       launched. 
  - visualize how the percentages of successful, failed, and cancelled plays are based on the set funding goal amounts. 

#Analysis and Challenges 

##Analysis

In our chart, “Outcomes Based on Launch Date,” the X-axis represents the months of the year when fundraising campaigns were launched for theater projects, and our Y-axis represents the number of those plays. 

Our blue line represents successful campaigns, our orange line represents campaigns that failed to reach their goals, and the grey line represents campaigns that were cancelled. 

Based on our blue line, we see that In the beginning of the year, there is moderate increase in successful campaigns going into February but that dips back down once we reach the month of March. However, there is a significant increase in the amount of successful campaigns coming out of the month of April and reaches its peak in the month of May, with 111 successful campaigns being launched. After may, that number decreases continuously all the way into September, with a small spike back up in October, and then the number continues to decline, until we reach the lowest amount of successful campaigns in the month of December. 

As for failed campaigns in our chart, they tend to not differ vastly in number throughout the year. However there is a signifiant spike back up in the number of failed Kickstarter campaigns in the month of October, which coincides with a very small spike in the number of successful campaigns in the same month. 

When comparing both lines, it seems that the months that there are increases of successful campaigns, there is also an increase in the number of unsuccessful campaigns, though not as dramatic of an increase. 

In our other chart, “Outcomes Based on Goals,” our X-axis represents the various Kickstarter fundraising goal amounts set for plays, starting with campaigns whose goals were less than $1000 dollars, and increasing by $5000 increments up to over $50,000.  Our Y-axis represents the success/failure percentages of those kickstarter campaigns. 

The blue line in our chart represents the percentage of successful campaigns, and our orange line represents the percentage of campaigns that failed to reach their fundraising goals. 

Based on our charts, we see that the highest percentage of success rates are with Kickstarter campaigns whose goals were less than $1000. Our percentage of success decrease continuously with a major dip when the fundraising goal reaches the $25,000-29,999 amount. Success percentages then begin to increase again and plateau between $35,000-39,999 and $40,000-44,999, before crashing back down to a zero percent rate for campaign goals of $45,000-49,999. Then there is a small increase in success percentage for campaign goals of over $50,000. 

##Challenges

Most of the challenges encountered had little to do with our data, and more to do with our analysts’s experience using Excel. 

#Results

Based on our analysis of the information displayed in the above charts,  we were able to come up with 3 conclusions that will be helpful to Louise in planning her next Kickstarter fundraising campaign. 

Our first two conclusions are based on the information gleamed from our chart, “Outcomes Based on Launch Date.” 

Based on our chart, our first conclusion is that it seems that the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for Theater productions is in the month of May. Our second conclusion is that the worst time to launch a Kickstarter campaign is the month of December. We can theorize that there are is more disposable income for potential donors around late Spring/early Summer and less around the holidays. 

Our final conclusion is based on the information in our chart, “Outcomes Based on Goals.” We can see that modest goal amounts are the most successful, so we can theorize that asking for less increases the chances of a campaigns success. However, while, the percentage of successful campaigns does dip very low around the $25,000-to 29,999 goal amount, there were a high percentage of successful campaigns around the $35,000-39,999 goal amounts. 

##Limitations of Date Set

Our main limitations as I see it, lay in our “Outcomes Based on Goals” chart. While we can see clearly the percentage of successful or unsuccessful campaigns, we still don’t have a clear reason why campaigns failed or succeeded. Potential ways we can gleam more useful information may be to include the types of productions being crowd-funded. If a production’s story for example doesn’t resonate in its description of the story they want to tell to potential donors, that may affect why donors don’t end up choosing to fund that play.
